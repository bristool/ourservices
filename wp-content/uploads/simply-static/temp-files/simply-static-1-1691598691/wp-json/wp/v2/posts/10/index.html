You&#8217;d see the DJs come out and how they hooked up the equipment and how they were creative with their music&#8230; They made people dance,&#8221; the 55-year-old, who now goes by the moniker DJ Cool Gee, continued.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They made people forget about all their problems, all their issues, all their worries &#8212; for one night they was able to be on like a mental vacation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s now referred to as old-school hip hop began developing in the late 1970s into the early 1980s, as the music went from the block to the nightclub.<\/p>\n<p>The classic DJ-MC live performance eventually saw the rap &#8212; the easiest element to isolate and package &#8212; go commercial and find resounding success.<\/p>\n<p>But even as it flourished, hip hop&#8217;s stories remained rooted in experiences of injustice and inequality.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hip hop&#8217;s greatest artists came out of tough times,&#8221; McDaniels said. &#8220;The greatest artists like Jay, Biggie, Nas, I&#8217;ve been to where they grew up at.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These are not great places, but they found love in that place,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And they knew and understood the people, and the families and the people and the smells and everything that goes along, and the pissy elevators.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And they took all of that color and stuff and put it in their records.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;The heart&#8217;<br \/>\nInto the 2000s, rappers including Kanye West, Jay-Z, Cardi B, Drake and Nicki Minaj were responsible for massive pop hits.<\/p>\n<p>Yet no matter how big, how rich, how dominant hip hop grew, it maintained the aura of the underdog, the counterculture.<\/p>\n<p>Year after year the Recording Academy faced backlash for failing to pay rappers their due, oft confining their Grammy wins to racialised categories.<\/p>\n<p>But as the streaming age has taken hold and hip hop&#8217;s unmistakable global influence &#8212; from music to fashion, language to dance &#8212; has become clear, what&#8217;s also evident is that hip hop is more movement than genre.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People weren&#8217;t really that accepting of hip hop &#8212; they thought it would fail,&#8221; said Paula Farley, 59, a Bronx native who started attending underground hip hop parties in her youth and returned to a recent celebration in the Bronx with Grandmaster Flash.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As you can see, 50 years later, we proved them wrong.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Even as the culture went global, for Farley, hip hop remains a New Yorker.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the heart, right here, the Bronx,&#8221; she told AFP, as performers warmed up the stage ahead of a throwback jam featuring Flash himself, complete with a troupe of breakdancers and appearances from the likes of Melle Mel and KRS-One.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the home of hip hop, the birth,&#8221; Farley said, as kids played in the deep summer heat, their parents and grandparents vibing to the beat.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is what it&#8217;s all about.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A genre, a culture and a lifestyle all at once: hip hop has traveled from the block party to the billionaire&#8217;s club, soundtracked protest and celebration, and asserted seismic influence over the course of pop.
